Parts

+ Android running on a raspberry pi 3 - https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi3/LineageOS16.0/
+ a 2 way acrylic mirror - https://www.plasticstockist.com/Acrylic-Mirror/Two-Way-See-Thru-Acrylic-Mirror-Sheet.aspx
+ LVDS to HDMI driver board
+ an old laptop monitor with LVDS (or a new one ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) (the darker the black value the better)
+ some velcro 3M strips, (black is better) - https://www.command.com/3M/en_US/command/products/~/Command-Black-Large-Picture-Hanging-Strips/?N=5924736+3294529207+3294737309&rt=rud
+ black acrylic paint
+ (optional) mini keyboard/mouse with a usb dongle (useful for debugging, means you dont have to take the mirror down to interact)

1. attach the pi and LVDS board to the wall with 3M command strips
2. 3d print some cubeoids as standoffs between the wall and the monitor. This ensures that when the mirror is added on top of the screen the electronics can find underneath
3. paint the back of the mirror where there is a border around the screen
4. attach the screen to the wall with 3M strips (you will need quite a few of these strips)
5. attach the mirror to the screen
